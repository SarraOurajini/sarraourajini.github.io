        <h1>This is
            <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>
        <div class="text">And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</div>
        <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
        <h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4>
        <p class="text">That's how much CSS it took to turn
            <a href="#">that grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all
            the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>Shit's still lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Still fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            And guess what, motherfucker:
        </h3>
        <div class="text">You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</div>
        <div>
            <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
            <p class="text">Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't
                be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter.
                If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
            <p class="text">If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty
                book.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
            <p class="text">Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've
                even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean
                7 fucking lines.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Size Matters</h2>
            <p class="text">I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller
                type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
            <p class="text">Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters
                long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
            <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
            <p class="text">I love what the creator of this
                <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">site's inspiration </a>did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites
                are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly.
                You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
